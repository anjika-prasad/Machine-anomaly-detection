# Machine-anomaly-detection

->Overview

This project focuses on detecting anomalies in industrial machines using Machine Learning techniques. The model helps identify potential failures in advance, allowing for predictive maintenance and reducing downtime. The application is built using Streamlit for an interactive and user-friendly interface.

->Features

*Anomaly Detection: Utilizes Isolation Forest to identify abnormal machine behavior.
*Interactive Dashboard: Built with Streamlit to visualize results dynamically.
*Real-time Predictions: Users can input new data and get immediate anomaly detection results.
*Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, feature scaling, and outlier detection.
*Model Training & Evaluation: Implements machine learning models to achieve high accuracy in anomaly detection.

->Technologies Used
*Python: Core programming language
*Streamlit: Web application framework
*Scikit-learn: Machine learning library for model training
*Pandas & NumPy: Data manipulation and numerical computing
*Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization
